Tools & Technologies Used Across Tasks
Power BI Desktop – for building interactive, compelling visualizations and reports.

Python (Jupyter Notebooks) – for data cleaning, analysis, model building, and EDA.

Data Visualization Libraries – such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and others depending on the task.

Tasks Overview
Task 01: Visualized the distribution of population demographics (age/gender) with bar charts/histograms to derive insights using Life Expectancy or population data.

Task 02: Performed EDA and data cleaning on a dataset (e.g., Titanic), exploring variable relationships and trends.

Task 03: Built and evaluated a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior using demographic and behavioral input.

Task 04: Conducted sentiment analysis on social media posts to understand public opinions and visualize sentiment distribution.

Why This Project Matters
Demonstrates a holistic workflow—from raw data to insights.

Highlights cross-functional skills: data ingestion, cleaning, visualization, modeling, and interpretation.

Suitable for sharing as part of a professional portfolio or LinkedIn showcase.
